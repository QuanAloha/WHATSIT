# WHATSIT

This app is designed to help people know what is in their food. It will provide 
information that they can and cannot see on the nutritional facts labels on their food items. 

The information inout section should take information for the user and then update a 
txt file for the barcode scanner and information display to use. 

The small_information.txt is a file that should be used to test smal bits of code as the app 
is developed. 

The information.txt file will contain the larger amount of information about different food
products that we can test the code on.
